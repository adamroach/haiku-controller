# Haiku Controller
Open Hardware Design for Controller for Big Ass Fan's "Haiku" Fans

I'm still getting this set up. Please stand by.

This is a list of the materials you will need to build a switch. I've included
links to Amazon for any components that are available there. I encourge you to
look around at local maker and hobbiest shops, though, as they frequently have
better prices. Beyond those things listed here, you'll also need a small
quantity of wire, some solder, and a handful of tools like a jewelers'
screwdriver and a soldering iron. And, of course, you'll need access to a 3D
printer.

The "Min Cost" column represents the price of the smallest quantity of the
specific item *available from Amazon*, and is meant to represent the maximum
price you'll pay for the materials.  With luck, you'll either have some of
these things lying around, or you'll be able to find them in smaller
quantities than is available from Amazon.

The Pi Zero W is generally available from around $10 online, but can be found
in many brick-and-mortar stores for $5. If you're lucky enough to live near
a [Microcenter](https://www.microcenter.com/), they're a reliable source for
inexpensive Pi Zero W's (and several of the other listed components, too).

If you're replacing an existing switch, re-use its mounting screws to put the
switch in the electrical box. Otherwise, you may need to pick up two #6-32 x 1½"
screws at a local hardware store.
